2. Click: **"Create new secret key"**
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

   Variable Name:  OPENAI_API_KEY
   Variable Value: sk-your-actual-key-here

## How to Verify It Worked:

### Test 1: Check Variables Tab
In Railway, go to Variables tab. You should see:
```
‚úÖ DATABASE_URL    (set by PostgreSQL)
‚úÖ OPENAI_API_KEY  (you just added)
‚úÖ PORT            (set by Railway)
```

### Test 2: Visit Your API
Open in browser:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "message": "Nego Challenge API",
  "version": "1.0",
  ...
}
```

### Test 3: Check Admin Dashboard
Open in browser:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/admin
```

Should show the admin interface with stats.

### Test 4: Test Chat API
Run in terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id":"test123","user_message":"INIT_GREETING"}'
```

Should return Bra Alex's greeting message.

## Still Getting the Error?

### Check These:

1. **Correct Service?**
   - Make sure you added the variable to the BACKEND service
   - NOT to the PostgreSQL database service

2. **Correct Variable Name?**
   - Must be exactly: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (all caps, with underscores)
   - Not: `OPENAI-API-KEY` or `openai_api_key`

3. **Valid API Key?**
   - Should start with `sk-`
   - No spaces before or after
   - Not expired or deleted

4. **Redeployed?**
   - Changes only take effect after redeploy
   - Check "Deployments" tab for latest status

5. **OpenAI Account Active?**
   - Check: https://platform.openai.com/usage
   - Verify you have credits
   - Check payment method is added
